![Website UI](assets/readme_images/ui.png)

A simple calculator website, presented as a project within The Odin Project web development curriculum.

In this website, I will apply what I have learned about objects in JavaScript from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

Which includes:

- Creating objects.
- Accessing object properties.
- Being able to use multiple object operators.
- Being able to use some powerful array functions.
